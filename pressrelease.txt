After recently celebrating its 5 year anniversary, the Vancouver Hackspace (VHS) have now decided it's time to give back to the global community, and the Vancouver community in particular. It does so by offering a unique and experimental startup incubator programme that leverages - between its members, keyholders and other experts - more than 100+ years of hands-on experience in hands-on development and being at the pen-ultimate forefront of new technology.

VHS is proud to present VHSdecel, a brand new proud Canadian hands-on alternative to academic product development and startup incubator. VHS is the opensource equivalent of traditional startup incubators. VHSdecel aims to alleviate the stress of a startup by providing the tools and experience of our veteran hackers to make startups fun again.
